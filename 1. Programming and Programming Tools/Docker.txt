docker-compose.yml 
	- its a file that has configuration for connecting different docker images, in a YML format
	- you basically list "services", give them names, and specify their attributes
	- the service attributes include
		- how often to restart (maybe on pull)
		- where is the build??
		- which image to use (pulled from docker-hub?)
		- containers name
		- what ports to map
		- which other services link to it

the docker-compose uses docker files for each service
