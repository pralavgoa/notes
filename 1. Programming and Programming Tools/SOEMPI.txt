SOEMPI Software
---------------


SOEMPI Tables
-------------

tbl_ds_* --> contain all the uploaded/sent datasets
	-- it contains a person id field
	-- fld_* are fields related to the data
	
	!!-- This might be the table that we can directly export and import

tbl_link_* -->
	
	--left_person_id contains the person id from the dataset referred to as left
	--right_person_id (similar as above)
	--binary_vector contains the vector associated with how closely the fields are related
	--continuous_vector similar to above but has decimal values
	--weight the weight given to the match
	--link_state whether it is a predicted match or a non-match
	
person_match --> contains the metadata of a match that has been performed
	-- person_match_id is the primary key
	-- match_title is the title supplied to the match, also the name of the generated table (without underscores)
	-- left_dataset is the id of the dataset as mentioned in the dataset table
	-- rigit_dataset similar as above
	-- 3 fields with binary data related to the match and block configuration
	-- total_records is the total nuber of record pairs
	-- k and fill factor for the bloom filter
	-- creater_id and date_created
	
dataset --> contains metadata about the imported/sent datasets
	-- dataset_id
	-- user_id
	-- table_name --> name of the database table created for this dataset
	-- file_name --> name of the file stored in the bin folder of jboss
	-- total_records --> number of rows
	-- imported_ind --> flags that indicates whether data has been imported
	-- date_created
	
SOEMPI PLAN
-----------

1. Have a virtual machine image ready that if fully configured to run
	--High configuration VM
	--full installation of SOEMPI and related software
	--make a configuration that is similar to the final experiments that we would conduct
	--test using local linkage
2. Make copies of this virtual machine image
3. Send a copy to each of the data providers
4. The data providers will export the data to a sql file and give it to us
    --test this on one of the copies of VMs created above
5. We import the data from these sql files, configure out data integrator and perform a match operation
    --run this test
