*******************************************************************************
Multithreading and Concurrency

Process - has resources (memory) and atleast 1 thread
Multitasking - running many processes on same machine. Processes are independent.

Time Slicing - each processes allocated certain time on cpu

Multithreading - share resources, managed by JVM scheduler. Have to find optimum number of threads by testing. Lookout for out-of-memory,starvation,cache inconsistencies on processors

Concurrency - break task into smaller pieces and run parallely.

Examples: GUI with background threads

-----------------------------------------
|       |Thread 0 ------------------>|
|Memory |   Thread 1 ------------->|
|       |
-----------------------------------------

multithreading helps use CPUs fully

  call start() will spawn a new thread
  Daemon threads can be shutdown anytime
  or create thread, and pass a runnable to constructor, then start

  Sharing data across threads
Mutual Exclusion and liveness issues
  Race conditions, deadlocks
Thread signalling and thread pools
  Producers and consumers
